# Nervestack Programming Language - Implementation Status

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the implementation status for the **Nervestack Programming Language (NSPL)**, developed by the **Nervestack Neuron Institute (NNI)**.

## 🚀 Core Features (Stable)

The following features have been verified and are fully functional in the current interpreter.

| Feature            | Description                                                   | Status     |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------- | ------------ | --------- |
| **Variables**      | Dynamic typing (`firm`) and constant definitions.             | ✅ Stable  |
| **I/O Operations** | User output (`show`) and input (`ask`) with type inference.   | ✅ Stable  |
| **Functions**      | Declarations (`spec`) and return values (`forward`).          | ✅ Stable  |
| **Control Flow**   | Conditionals (`when`/`otherwise`) and the `traverse` loop.    | ✅ Stable  |
| **Error Handling** | Structured blocks (`attempt`, `trap`, `conclude`).            | ✅ Stable  |
| **OOP Foundation** | Blueprints, constructors (`prep`), and inheritance (`adopt`). | ✅ Stable  |
| **Strings**        | Advanced string interpolation (`"                             | expression | "`) support. | ✅ Stable |

## 🧪 Experimental Features

These features are implemented in the grammar and parser, but are currently undergoing runtime optimization and verification.

- **Concurrency Models**: Keywords `paral`, `hold`, `signal`, and `listen` are supported by the lexer/parser.
- **Modular System**: `toolkit`, `plug`, and `share` modules are in early access testing.
- **Functional Primitives**: `transform` (map) and `condense` (reduce) are planned for high-performance data processing.
- **Serialization**: Native support for `pack` and `unpack` of data structures.

## 🗺️ Roadmap & Future Enhancements

The **Nervestack Neuron Institute** is committed to the continuous improvement of the **Universal User-oriented Programming (UOP)** paradigm.

1.  **Strict Mode**: Optional type annotations for increased performance and safety.
2.  **Standard Library Expansion**: Native math, filesystem, and networking toolkits.
3.  **Cross-Platform Runtime**: Optimized C++ backend for embedded and high-performance environments.
4.  **IDE Support**: Enhanced VS Code extension with neural-assisted refactors.

## 🔍 Verification

To verify the current implementation status on your local machine:

```bash
# Run the core language feature test suite
nervestack run examples/test_simple.ns

# Run the loop and interpolation test
nervestack run test_traverse.ns
```
