# 🧠 Nervestack (NSPL)
### The Easiest to Read. The Fastest to Run.

Nervestack is a futuristic **Universal User-oriented Programming (UOP)** language. It's designed to be as readable as English while running with the blazing speed of C++.

## ⚡ Quick Start (30 Seconds)

1. **Clone & Build**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ADIVIDAN1012/Nervestack-Neuron-Institute-NNI.git
   cd Nervestack-Neuron-Institute-NNI
   cd src/runtime; .\build.bat; cd ../..
   ```

2. **Write your first program** (`hello.nspl`)
   ```nervestack
   show "Hello, Nervestack!"
   ```

3. **Run it instantly**
   ```bash
    python tools/scripts/run_file.py hello.nspl
   ```

## 🚀 Why Nervestack?

### 1. Easy to Read (Python Frontend)
Nervestack uses a Python-based intelligent parser that understands English-like keywords. No more cryptic symbols.
```nervestack
spec greet with name:
    show "Hello, |name|! Welcome to the future."
done

greet "Developer"
```

### 2. Fast to Run (C++ Runtime)
Once parsed, your code is executed by a high-performance **C++ engine**. You get the simplicity of Python with the raw power of C++.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Natural Syntax**: `when`, `otherwise`, `traverse`, `until`, `attempt`.
- **Intelligent I/O**: `ask` for input, `show` for output.
- **Modern OOP**: `blueprint` (classes), `adopt` (inheritance), `spawn` (instances).
- **Safe & Robust**: Native `attempt-trap-conclude` error handling.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.10+**
- **C++ Compiler** (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)

### Detailed Setup
```bash
# 1. Get the code
git clone https://github.com/ADIVIDAN1012/Nervestack-Neuron-Institute-NNI.git
cd Nervestack-Neuron-Institute-NNI

# 2. Build the C++ Engine
cd src/runtime
.\build.bat
cd ../..
```
